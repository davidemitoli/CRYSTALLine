"""Primitive ↔ crystallographic (conventional) cell views of a structure.

Building the crystallographic cell the way a crystallographer expects to see it
is two steps: get the right *lattice* (with the right number of atoms), then
place those atoms into the drawn cell box sensibly.

**Lattice — the centring expansion.** For a centred lattice (F, I, C, R…) the
primitive cell CRYSTAL works in holds fewer atoms than the conventional cell
(an FCC crystal's 2-atom primitive cell vs. its 8-atom cubic cell). We expand
with the integer matrix ``M`` where ``conventional_vectors = M · primitive_vectors``
(``det M`` = the centring multiplicity: 1 for P, 2 for I/C, 3 for R, 4 for F),
applied via ``ase.build.make_supercell``. A P lattice (dry ice's Pa-3, say) has
``M = I`` and is left untouched. Not pymatgen's
``get_conventional_standard_structure``: that re-orders atoms (destroying the
ordering phonon eigenvectors rely on) and re-wraps them. The tiling instead
keeps every conventional atom mapped to the primitive atom it came from, which
is what lets phonon modes animate on the conventional cell too (see
:func:`expand_modes_to_conventional`).

**Placement — molecule-aware wrapping.** CRYSTAL centres its coordinates on the
origin (fractional roughly ``[-0.5, 0.5]``), but the viewport draws the cell box
as ``[0, 1)``, so half the atoms fall outside it and any molecule straddling a
face renders as broken fragments (dry ice's four CO₂ show up as one molecule
plus three bare carbons). :func:`_wrap_molecules` reconstructs whole molecules
across the periodic boundary and translates each into the box. Wrapping is only
ever integer lattice translations, so atom order — and thus the phonon
correspondence — is preserved.

pymatgen/ase are imported lazily so ``core`` stays importable (and unit-testable)
without them, matching ``crystalio.loader``. No function mutates its argument.
