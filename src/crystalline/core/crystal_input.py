"""Generate a CRYSTAL23 ``.d12`` input deck from a :class:`Structure`.

This is the write-side companion to :mod:`crystalline.crystalio.loader`: the app
already *reads* CRYSTAL geometries and *plots* CRYSTAL results, and this module
lets it *author* the input that produces them — closing the build → run →
visualise loop in one tool.

A CRYSTAL deck is three (or four) ``END``-terminated blocks:

1. **Geometry** — a title, a dimensionality keyword (``CRYSTAL``/``MOLECULE``/…),
   the space group, the *minimal* lattice parameters, and the **asymmetric unit**
   (one representative atom per symmetry orbit). Geometry keywords (``SCELPHONO``)
   and task blocks (``OPTGEOM``, ``FREQCALC``, ``EOS``, ``ELASTCON``, ``QHA``,
   ``CPHF``) live here too.
2. **Basis set** — one ``BASISSET`` card naming an internal library. ``BASISSET``
   also serves as block 1's terminator (it "replaces the final END").
3. **Hamiltonian / SCF** — an optional ``DFT…END`` sub-block (functional, grid),
   then ``SHRINK`` (k-mesh) and convergence keywords, closed by ``END``.

Design choices for this first cut (see the module's tests for the exact decks):

* **Geometry is derived, not asked for.** The asymmetric unit is found with the
  same pymatgen ``SpacegroupAnalyzer`` that ``loader.save_structure_gui`` uses,
  so the space group and cell agree with what the ``.gui`` writer would produce.
  We symmetrise the *conventional standard* cell (not the primitive input), so a
  cubic crystal prints one ``a`` and fractional coordinates in the standard
  setting with flags ``0 0 0``. Any failure falls back to a ``P1`` listing of
  every atom — a valid deck, never a hard error (mirroring the ``.gui`` writer).
* **Scope.** Every dimensionality is written, each with its own coordinate
  convention (3D fractional; 2D ``x,y`` fractional and ``z`` in Å; 1D ``x``
  fractional and ``y,z`` in Å; 0D all Å) and its own minimal set of lattice
  parameters. Symmetry reduction to the asymmetric unit is applied to 3D
  crystals; slabs and polymers are written in their trivial group with every
  atom listed, because the layer/rod-group orbits needed to reduce them are not
  available here. Cells whose periodic directions are not already the ones
  CRYSTAL expects (slab in ``xy``, polymer along ``x``) are rotated into place.
* **Basis sets** are CRYSTAL's internal libraries via ``BASISSET`` (all-electron,
  so plain atomic numbers, no ECP offset).

pymatgen is imported lazily so ``core`` stays importable (and unit-testable)
without a display, matching the rest of the package.
