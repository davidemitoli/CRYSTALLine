"""The anharmonic potential-energy surface an ANHAPES run computes, and the
figures built from it.

CRYSTAL numerically differentiates the energy along its normal modes and prints
what it finds as cubic and quartic terms: one set per mode, one set per coupled
pair, and — on a large run — one per coupled triplet. Together they are a
quartic Taylor expansion of the PES in the dimensionless normal coordinates,

.. math::
    V = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\omega_I\\xi_I^2 + \\tfrac{1}{6}\\eta_{III}\\xi_I^3
        + \\tfrac{1}{24}\\eta_{IIII}\\xi_I^4
        + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\eta_{IIJ}\\xi_I^2\\xi_J + \\ldots

and what one wants to look at is a cut through it: one mode on its own, or the
surface of a pair. This module is the single point of contact with the two
CRYSTALClear functions that draw those.

Three things shape the interface:

* **the harmonic bowl swamps everything.** The anharmonic terms are worth a few
  percent of it over the range the constants were fitted on, so contours of the
  total surface are ellipses and show nothing. The default is to take the
  harmonic part out and map what is left.
* **there can be hundreds of pairs.** A 36-mode run couples 630 of them, which
  is not a combo box; :attr:`PESRun.pairs` comes back sorted by how strongly the
  two modes actually couple, so the interesting ones are at the top.
* **the constants are a local fit.** CRYSTAL differentiates over a fraction of
  a classical amplitude either side of equilibrium, so a wide window is an
  extrapolation of a quartic. Hence a modest default range.

Kept Qt-free, like the sibling modules, so the mapping from "what the user
picked" to "which CRYSTALClear call" stays testable on its own.
