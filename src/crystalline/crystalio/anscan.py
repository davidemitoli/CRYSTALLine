"""The anharmonic scan of one normal mode, and the figure built from it.

ANSCAN walks a single normal mode away from equilibrium, fits a polynomial to
the energies it finds, and solves the one-dimensional vibrational problem in
that potential. What one wants to see is all of it at once: the scanned points,
the fitted potential, the levels it supports and the states sitting on them —
which is what ``CRYSTALClear.plot.plot_cry_anscan`` draws, and this module is
the single point of contact with it.

Everything is expressed in the dimensionless coordinate :math:`\\xi` the scan
is run on, the ``[DISPLAC]`` column of the output, so the abscissa needs no
choosing. Two things do:

* **how tall to draw the wavefunctions.** They are normalised, so their height
  in cm⁻¹ is arbitrary and has to be set against the level spacing of the run —
  a factor of 500 on a stiff CO₂ stretch, 30 on a soft double well. Rather than
  ask, :attr:`AnscanRun.scale_wf` reads it off the levels themselves.
* **the companion file.** The wavefunction coefficients are not in the ``.out``
  at all but in ANSCANWF.DAT, so a plot needs a second file; :func:`find_wavefunctions`
  looks for it next to the output before anyone is prompted.

Kept Qt-free, like the sibling modules, so the mapping from "what the user
picked" to "which CRYSTALClear call" stays testable on its own.
