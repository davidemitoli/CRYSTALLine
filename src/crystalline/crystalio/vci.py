"""VCI wavefunctions held in a CRYSTAL output, and the figures built from them.

A VCI state is a linear combination of zeroth-order configurations
:math:`\\Psi_s = \\sum_n A_{n,s} \\Phi^\\mathbf{n}`, and what one wants to see is
which configurations mix into which state — that is where the anharmonicity
shows up, as a resonance between a fundamental and an overtone. CRYSTALClear
draws that two ways, and this module is the single point of contact with them:

* ``"map"`` — heatmap of :math:`A_{n,s}`, one row per configuration and one
  column per state, labelled by its energy relative to the ZPE.
* ``"sankey"`` — the same numbers as ribbons whose width is the weight of a
  configuration in a state, which reads better for a handful of states.

The zeroth-order basis is not the same in the two flavours of the calculation:
a VCI@HO run expands on Hartree products of harmonic eigenfunctions, a VCI@VSCF
run on products of VSCF modals. CRYSTALClear detects which from the output and
labels the quanta accordingly, so nothing here has to choose.

Parsing a VCI block is not free — a run with tens of thousands of states takes a
second or two — so :func:`has_vci` answers the cheap question "is there one at
all?" for menu enabling, and the full parse happens only once the user asks for
a plot.

Kept Qt-free, like the sibling modules, so the mapping from "what the user
picked" to "which CRYSTALClear call" stays testable on its own.
